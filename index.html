                    In 2003, Food Quest opened its first location in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Focussed entirely on serving the perfect food, the tiny take-out restaurant located in the city's busy Entertainment District created a sensation in the area winning praise from food critics and numerous people's choice awards. Over the years, the Chef and founder of Food Quest, SR Tamim, together with his family and friends, have opened a select number of additional Food Quest restaurants.
